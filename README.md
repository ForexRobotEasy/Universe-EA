## How Universe EA Works

The code provided is a simplified version of the Universe EA. Here is a brief description of how it works:

1. The Expert Advisor includes the necessary library, `Trade.mqh`, for executing trades.
2. The `OnInit()` function is the entry point of the EA. It initializes the `CTrade` class for executing trades.
3. The trading account balance is set using the `SetBalance()` function.
4. The account balance is checked to ensure it is sufficient for trading.
5. If the balance is sufficient, the lot size is calculated based on the account balance.
6. A buy order is opened using the `Buy()` function.
7. A message is printed to the Experts tab indicating the success or failure of the buy order.
8. The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the EA is deinitialized. It prints a message to the Experts tab.
9. The `OnTick()` function is the main execution function of the EA. It simply prints a message to the Experts tab indicating that the EA is running.

Please note that this code is a simplified example and does not include all the features and functions mentioned in the Terms of Reference. The actual Universe EA would have additional functionality for trading, risk management, compatibility with different strategies, and a user-friendly interface.
